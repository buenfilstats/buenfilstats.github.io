### Course Description

STAT 512 is the first course of the statistical inference sequence for first-year PhD and master students in Statistics at the University of Washington. It roughly covers Chapter 1-5 of [Statistical Inference, Second Edition]() written by George Casella and Roger L. Burger with some possible discussions on selected contents in Chapter 7 and 10, and STAT 513 covers the rest of the book. Generally, the instructor wrote his own notes for teaching the course; see below. The quiz session led by the TA is designed for 
- reviewing some key concepts in the lectures;
- discussing important concepts that supplement the lectures;
- going through some exercises that help strengthen the understanding of lecture materials or providing insights into other related study fields.
