### Course Descriptions

This is the second honor course for elite sophomores of the Applied Mathematics group at Yat-sen Honor College. As what we conducted in the first course ([Fourier Analysis and its Applications](https://zhangyk8.github.io/teaching/fourier)), the enrolled student will continue lecturing to the class in a pre-assigned order, following the main stream of the prestigious textbook, _Matrix Analysis (Written by Roger A. Horn and Charles R. Johnson)_.

### Acknowledgement

Again, I am grateful to Professor Lixin Yan for giving me a valuable opportunity to discuss matrix-oriented problems with younger Math enthusiasts and deepen my understanding of matrices, a fundamental concept penetrating in all fields of science.
