Notes: The title "Resonance" of this page is inspired and adopted from a probabilistic philosophy book entitled with [Resonance. From Probability to Epistemology and Back](https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/p1073) and authored by Professor [Krzysztof Burdzy](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~burdzy/), who opened a new door of probability theory and Brownian motion for me.

1. A very inspiring and encouraging poem written by William Ernest Henley: [Invictus](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51642/invictus). 
   * It also empowered Nelson Mandela, a former President of South Africa and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, to get through the darkest moment in his life.
